urxvt-fontcycle

This rxvt-unicode (urxvt) extension provides the ability to have
multiple fonts configured and easily switch between them at runtime.

This can allow you to (among other things) easily increase and decrease
font size.  But it's more than that because you choose the fonts to cycle
between, it's not just one font.

Please see perldoc font-cycle for the manual.
